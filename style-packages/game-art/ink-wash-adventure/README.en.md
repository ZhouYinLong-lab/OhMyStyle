## Overview

以墨线、洗染、留白、有限朱色与清晰前中后景组织可探索画面；本包控制游戏媒介与水墨表现，不固定旅人、桥、神社或任何具体故事。

This is an independently usable style package. It turns observable medium,
composition, lighting, color, surface, texture, and reproduction decisions into
executable guidance for new subjects. It is not intended to reproduce a specific
work.

## Curatorial note

The point of this game-art direction is not to turn every image into an ink-wash postcard. Brushwork also carries spatial information: stronger contours clarify nearby routes, wash and paper space open distance, and vermilion or indigo appears only where the scene needs a focal or navigational cue. When the subject changes to an interior, character, or object, that readable exploratory layering should remain.

## Subject independence

This package controls *how* an image is generated, not *what* it depicts.
People, objects, places, architecture, plants, vehicles, and narrative come
from your prompt. Concrete scenes in this package are examples or tests only
and must never be added as default content.

## Read before use

- `identity.yaml`: scope, subjects, and exclusions
- `visual-signature.yaml`: features that should survive a subject change
- `reproduction.yaml`: medium, materials, and construction order
- `prompts/base.txt`, `prompts/negative.txt`: prompt constraints
- `palette/palette.json`: color roles and values
- `evaluation.yaml`: post-generation checks
- `references/manifest.csv`, `provenance.yaml`: sources and rights boundaries

## Sources and rights

References are used for research and visual analysis. External artworks,
photographs, game imagery, trademarks, and platform pages remain the property of
their respective rights holders. Generated examples are new anonymous scenes and
are not original works by, or endorsements from, the referenced person, movement,
school, or game.

See [`provenance.yaml`](provenance.yaml),
[`references/manifest.csv`](references/manifest.csv), and the repository
[`NOTICE`](../../../NOTICE) for source and redistribution boundaries.

## Use only this package

Choose one of the following methods.

### Method 1: Give the package to an image-capable Agent

Upload this package directory to an Agent, or provide its local path, and ask:

```text
Use this style package to help me generate an image.

First read identity.yaml, visual-signature.yaml, reproduction.yaml,
prompts/base.txt, prompts/negative.txt, palette/palette.json, and evaluation.yaml.
Compile their rules into the generation process. Do not use only the style name
as a prompt and do not copy a reference work.

My image request is:
<subject, objects, scene, aspect ratio, and purpose>

Compile the full prompt first, then generate the image. After generation, check
style features, composition, color, material, AI artifacts, and request adherence
against evaluation.yaml, and report remaining risks.
```

### Method 2: Copy the prompts

Replace the subject, objects, scene, and aspect ratio in `prompts/base.txt` and
send `prompts/negative.txt` as the negative prompt. Use the visual signature and
palette for tighter control.

### Method 3: Submit through your own API tool

Configure your API key in your own image platform or prompt compiler, then submit
the base prompt, negative constraints, palette, and any required reference list.
The repository does not host a generation service or manage API keys.

### Method 4: Local model + ComfyUI

Connect the prompts to a local model or ComfyUI workflow. Use the palette,
reproduction notes, and reference manifest to set color, composition, material,
and lighting. Review the output against `evaluation.yaml`.

Users manage model weights, API keys, and generated images themselves. References
are for observable traits only; do not copy a source work's exact composition,
figures, text, trademark, or logo.
